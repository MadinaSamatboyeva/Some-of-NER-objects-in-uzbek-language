Hello!
My name is Madina Samatboyeva, and I am 27 years old.
Education: Bachelor’s degree in Uzbek Philology (2022) and Master’s degree in Computational Linguistics (2024). Currently, I am a doctoral student at the Department of Social and Humanitarian Sciences and Information Technologies, Tashkent State University of Uzbek Language and Literature.

My research focuses on the automatic identification of NER (Named Entity Recognition) objects in Uzbek texts. The Uzbek language belongs to the Turkic language family. Its grammar, sentence structure, and morphological and syntactic analysis are rather complex. This complexity necessitates the use of large language models (LLMs) and their application in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for developing language-related software tools.

In our research, we study the properties of NER objects within the framework of Uzbek grammar, analyzing them in accordance with the grammatical structure of the Uzbek language.
